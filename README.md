# Space Sqaush
A Unity 2D game that is a sort of local multiplayer version of Breakout (Like Squash) in the sense that you need to hit the ball against the back wall in such a way as for the other player to miss it.
It includes an AI system based on A\* pathfinding and powerups to make things interesting.
This was built in Unity 4 mostly so there may be issues here.
